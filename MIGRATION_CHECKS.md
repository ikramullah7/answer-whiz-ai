# Local repository migration checks — 28 October 2026

Source: `/Users/ikram/source/rag-ind/ragflow`.
Destination: `/Users/ikram/source/answer-whiz-ai`.

Completed:

- Original source and branded frontend copied without original Git history.
- New `origin` preserved: `https://github.com/ikramullah7/answer-whiz-ai.git`.
- `git ls-remote origin` returned no refs. No commit or push performed.
- Original LICENSE preserved byte-for-byte, along with source copyright notices.
- Required frontend environment configuration restored; safe Docker environment templates added.
- Existing Docker configuration and credentials copied byte-for-byte to ignored local files with mode 600.
- Git candidate file scan found no matching local passwords or common OpenAI/GitHub/AWS token patterns. Such scans are not a guarantee that every possible secret is detected.
- Private-key pattern matches reviewed: the bundled upstream login key and fake/generated SSH test-key material. These are not personal provider credentials. Bundled login keys are not suitable as a production secret boundary and must be considered separately for production hardening.
- Git candidates exclude local credentials, runtime logs, frontend build output, and installed dependencies.
- Inherited workflows moved out of `.github/workflows` so upstream release schedules, publishing, and self-hosted jobs will not run on a later push.
- Compose configuration validates without starting Docker or Colima. Project name remains `docker`; the five existing named data volumes are preserved.
- All published ports bind to localhost. Elasticsearch retains its 3 GiB limit and 1 GiB JVM heap.
- Frontend mount resolves to this destination's `web/dist`, read-only. Production build completes with AnswerWhizAI title and configuration.
- Existing login test suite: 5 passed.
- Full frontend type-check: 207 known errors, matching the earlier results after normalizing repository paths and line shifts. This migration does not fix those issues.
- Colima verified stopped; no containers or application started during this migration.

Remaining approval gates:

1. User approves starting Colima and the application from this folder.
2. Verify runtime health and data continuity, then user manually tests login, datasets, chat, citations, and OpenAI configuration. The upstream system administrator account was initialized with its default password; change it through supported admin functionality when testing. Normal workspace accounts are separate.
3. Only after successful manual testing and explicit approval: review and commit the initial source snapshot, then push to the new remote.

Limitations:

- GitHub repository visibility could not be independently verified with `gh` because GitHub CLI is not authenticated; confirm Private in GitHub settings before the first push.
- No visual browser test performed during this stopped-services preparation.
- Native Go build was not run; this deployment reuses the existing v1.0.0-rc2 ARM64 backend image.
- The optional native PDF testdata symlink remains unresolved as in the original checkout; local downloaded fixtures were not copied.
